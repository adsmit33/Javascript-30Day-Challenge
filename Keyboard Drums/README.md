# Keyboard Drums
Day 1 of the 30-day Vanilla-JS Challeng

## What I Learned
You can create data- binds to HTML elements.
```html
<div class="key" data-key="76">
```
These data binds can then be selected through the use of a querySelector
```javascript
document.querySelector(`div[data-key="76"]`);
```
